# PythonMetaMap Interactive Ultimate - Fixes Applied

## Date: 2025-07-09

### Issues Fixed:

1. **WSL xdg-open Error**
   - Added WSL detection to properly open file explorer in Windows Subsystem for Linux
   - The `_open_file_explorer` method now:
     - Detects if running in WSL by checking for 'microsoft' in platform release or WSL environment variables
     - Converts WSL paths to Windows paths using `wslpath`
     - Opens Windows Explorer instead of xdg-open when in WSL
     - Falls back gracefully with error message if opening fails

2. **Search Concepts Column Name Compatibility**
   - Fixed the search_concepts method to handle different CSV column name formats
   - Now dynamically detects column names:
     - CUI column: 'CUI'
     - Concept column: 'ConceptName', 'Concept_Name'
     - Preferred name column: 'PrefName', 'Preferred_Name', 'preferred_name'
     - Semantic types column: 'SemTypes', 'Semantic_Types', 'semantic_types'
   - Search now works across all detected columns with proper error handling

3. **Analysis Templates Added**
   - Added 5 pre-configured analysis templates for common medical text analysis use cases:
     1. **Clinical Summary Analysis** - For analyzing clinical summaries
     2. **Radiology Report Analysis** - For extracting findings from radiology reports
     3. **Medication Review** - For comprehensive medication analysis
     4. **Symptom Analysis** - For detailed symptom extraction
     5. **Laboratory Results Analysis** - For analyzing lab test results
   
   - Each template includes:
     - Predefined filter terms
     - Relevant semantic types
     - Custom report sections
     - Automated filtering and categorization

4. **Enhanced Analysis Menu**
   - Added "Template-based Analysis" option to the analysis tools menu
   - Template selection interface with descriptions
   - Automated report generation based on selected template
   - Results displayed in formatted tables with export to Markdown

### Files Modified:
- `/mnt/c/Users/Layth M Qassem/Desktop/PythonMetaMap/src/pymm/cli/interactive_ultimate.py`

### Dependencies:
- All required dependencies (pandas, numpy, etc.) are already in requirements.txt
- No new dependencies needed

### Usage:
1. Run the interactive mode: `pymm interactive`
2. Navigate to "Analysis Tools" from the main menu
3. Select "Search concepts" to search across all processed files
4. Select "Template-based Analysis" for pre-configured analysis workflows
5. Use "Open in file explorer" option which now works correctly in WSL

### Technical Details:
- Import added: `platform` module for WSL detection
- Column name detection is now flexible and handles multiple naming conventions
- Template system is extensible - new templates can be added to ANALYSIS_TEMPLATES dictionary
- All file paths remain absolute as required
