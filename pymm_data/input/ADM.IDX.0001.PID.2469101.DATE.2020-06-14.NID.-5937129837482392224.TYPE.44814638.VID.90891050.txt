Patient reports of left knee pain that began in October or November of 2019. He works part time as a driver with Fedex. His pain eventually worsened and in January in 2019, he was going out of his truck and had excruciating pain on the posterior aspect of his knee. Right before 02/23/20, he presented to a orthopedics walk in clinic where he received a steroid injection which resolved his posterior knee pain. However, he continued to have medial sided pain. He returned to the clinic and had an MRI which showed a meniscus tear.  He reports of catching with twisting of his knees. He has been doing exercise, wearing a hinged knee brace, ice and home therapy with minimal relief.

Review of Systems:  10 organ ROS was negative except as per HPI.    Physical Exam:  -No major changes from last visit, see prior note    Imaging:  Pertinent radiology was reviewed.    ASSESSMENT  [**DOCTOR] Head is a [**AGE] y.o. male who presents for surgery as stated above.     Risks of surgery discussed and informed consent obtained. Risks discussed include (but not limited to) bleeding, infection, need for revision, failed surgery, damage to surrounding structures, blood clot, and more.     PLAN  Proceed with surgery as planned. Post op protocol as previously established.     Mr. Head will likely be provided with an opioid prescription after surgery. The reason for this prescription is for pain control following Surgery. Alternatives to opioid medications, including no pain medication, and over the counter pain medication were considered, but thought to be inadequate given the typical level of pain associated with this surgery. Thus, an appropriate duration of pain medication will be prescribed.
