Hospital Course:
[**PATIENT] is a [**AGE] year old male with PMH most significant for OLT 04/2018 for decompensated cirrhosis in the setting of prior alcohol use disorder and alpha-1 antitrypsin heterozygosity, HLD, HTN, recurrent falls who presents with fall and L femoral fracture, now s/p L trochanteric femoral nailing with Ortho 11/23.
Hospital course complicated by multiple vitamin/mineral deficiencies (D, C, folic acid, iron) and constipation.
 
The patient fell at his home outside on 11/21.
He was coming out of the bathroom and he says his legs felt weak.
He fell onto his left side.
Did not hit his head.
Pain is a 5/10.
Unable to ambulate.

He broke his wrist from a fall 6 months ago.
Does not get lightheaded when standing.
Has about 1 fall a month.
 
At OSH, afebrile, BP 156/61, HR 95, RR 20, SpO2 98%.
Found to have L femur fracture on XR.
UA with 4+ bacteria, 1+ leuk est, negative nitrite, 50-100 WBC.
Given 1 g ceftriaxone.
Transferred to [**HOSPITAL] for higher level of care.
 
In the ED, T 100.2, BP 167/55, HR 94, RR 18, SpO2 99%.

CTH without acute abnormality.

Received 50 mcg IV fentanyl.
Evaluated by Ortho.
Admitted to [**HOSPITAL] for further workup and management.
Floor course:
The following day the patient went to the OR with orthopedic surgery on 03/24 with left trochanteric femoral nailing.
Patient came back to the medicine floor and was managed postop with intermittent doses of oxycodone scheduled Tylenol.
Patient did well from this perspective.
Given that the patient has a history of osteopenia and now has osteoporotic fracture, decision was made to start patient on bisphosphonate as an outpatient.
Ultimately patient daughter reported that the patient has had more falls in the past 6 months.
This was felt to be a mechanical fall.
Was not able to do orthostatics given surgery and fracture but patient was noted to intermittently be borderline hypotensive and so his losartan was discontinued.
Continued on his home amlodipine with better blood pressures.
PT OT saw the patient and recommended inpatient rehab but patient's daughter would like for him to be close at home also will be going to SNF.
Recommend starting Fosamax q.
weekly.
Can consider repeat DEXA scan in the future.
Will remain on vitamin D and calcium supplementation.
Hospital course complicated by constipation after surgery and narcotics.
Bowel regimen was uptitrated and patient had multiple bowel movements.
Kept on a daily MiraLAX and senna to be held if he has a bowel movement within 24 hours.
Regarding his anemia, patient was found to be iron deficient.
Also had low folic acid and this was supplemented.
He was given back IV iron x2 this hospitalization.
Additionally, patient was found to be vitmain c deficient as well.
Patient was also thought to be vitamin K deficient given an INR value that was high and then down trended with vitamin K supplementation.
His celiac panel was negative.
He has [**DOCTOR] level that is pending.
Additionally, patient's had some concerns about the patient's 
cognitive status at home.
A [**DOCTOR] was performed and patient scored 19/30, actually improved from previous 12 out of 30.
Patient has good home support but may benefit from neurocognitive testing the outpatient setting.
Patient was discharged in stable condition to local SNF.

PT Treatment Interventions: Bed Mobility Training, Transfer Training, Gait Training, Therapeutic Exercise, Posture Training, Transfer Balance Training, Gait Balance Training, Sustained Activity Training with Transfers and/or Gait, Patient/Family/Caregiver Education, Follow-up recommendations, [**DOCTOR] Training
Treatment Frequency: 4x/wk
Treatment focus: overall functional mobility, bilateral upper extremities, bilateral lower extremities, head, and trunk as appropriate
To do:
-Patient to attend PT/OT with SNF, f/u with orthopedics has been scheduled for 04/20.
Would consider DVT ppx at SNF - have been giving Lovenox 40 mg daily in house.
Per ortho, will need 21 days from surgery 11/13.
-WC: per ortho, dressings changes as needed, okay to let water over wound and soap.
-Fosfamax weekly, Vitamin C supp, Vitamin D supplementation, laxatives as needed, folic acid supplement
-f/u with hepatology clinic has been requested
-f/u [**DOCTOR]
- would provide boost/nutrition high protein supplement
